# Psychic-Game
The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.  

The user will be able to see the following:
* Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
* Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
* Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
* Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
